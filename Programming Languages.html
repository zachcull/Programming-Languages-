	<h2>Basic Info</h2>

	<p>Name of language, When? Where? By who?<br>
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally name C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>

	<p>What purpose does the language serve?<br>
C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general purpose, case sensitive, free form programming language that supports procedural, object oriented, and generic programming. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.</p>
	
	<p>Give an example of code written in the language.<br><br>
	<code><pre>
	// &quot;Hello World! program
	#include <iostream>
	int main()
	{
	  std::cout << &quot;Hello World!&quot; << std::endl;
	  return 0;
	}</pre></code></p>

	<p>Interpreted or Compiled? Strongly or Weakly typed? Imperative, Functional, or Logical?<br>
Compiled. Can be strong or weak but mainly strong. Functional. In the context of the programming language C++, functional refers to a header file that is part of the C++ Standard Library and provides a set of predefined class templates for function objects, including operations for arithmetic, comparisons, and logic.</p>
